<strong>ft_irc</strong> is a 42 School <strong>C++</strong> Project that implements an <strong>IRC server</strong> compatible with standard IRC clients.<br />
The server allows users to <strong>authenticate</strong>, set nicknames, <strong>join channels</strong>, and communicate through <strong>private and public messages</strong>.
It also includes <strong>role-based permissions</strong>, with operators having special privileges to manage channels and enforce rules.

<span style={{ display: 'block', textAlign: 'center', fontSize: '28px' }}>**Important Guidelines**</span>

- **Communication**: The server must use <strong>TCP/IP</strong> for communication.
- **Compatibility**: The server should be fully compatible with the chosen IRC client. (<strong>irssi</strong> in the video)
- **Reliability**: The server must adhere to <strong>IRC protocol standards</strong>, minimizing errors and providing a reliable experience.

This project focuses on implementing a reliable IRC server with role-based permissions, essential commands, and channel management, offering a foundational exercise in network communication and protocol adherence.
