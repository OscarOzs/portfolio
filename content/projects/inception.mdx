**<u>Inception</u>**

42 School Project

The Inception project aims to set up a mini-infrastructure of various services within a virtual machine, adhering to specific rules. The entire setup must be done using Docker Compose.

**Key Requirements:**

Virtual Machine: All services must run within a virtual machine.

Docker Compose: Mandatory use of Docker Compose for orchestration.

Containerization: Each service must run in its dedicated Docker container.

Images: Containers should be built from the penultimate stable versions of Alpine or Debian, using custom Dockerfiles.

Dockerfiles: Each service must have its own Dockerfile, invoked by a Makefile in the docker-compose.yml file.

**Services to Implement:**

NGINX Container: Must support TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 only.

WordPress Container: Includes WordPress with php-fpm, excluding NGINX.

MariaDB Container: For database management, excluding NGINX.


**Volumes:**

One volume for the WordPress database.
Another volume for WordPress site files.
Docker Network: To connect all containers.
Resilience: Containers must restart in case of a crash.
