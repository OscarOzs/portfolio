Philosophers is a 42 School Project developed as part of the 42 School curriculum, adhering to <strong>strict coding norms</strong> and requirements.<br />
The objective is to simulate the <strong>dining philosophers problem</strong>, focusing on <strong>thread management</strong> and synchronization using <strong>C</strong>.

<span style={{ display: 'block', textAlign: 'center', fontSize: '28px' }}>**Project Overview**</span>

- <span style={{ fontSize: '20px' }}><u>Coding Standards</u></span>
  - **Language**: The project is coded in C and follows the <strong>42 Norm</strong>, with any leaks, crashes, undefined behaviors, or norm errors resulting in a failing grade.

- <span style={{ fontSize: '20px' }}><u>Simulation Setup</u></span>
  - **Philosophers at a Table**: A number of philosophers are seated around a circular table, each performing one of three activities: eating, thinking, or sleeping. Each philosopher engages in only one activity at a time.

<span style={{ display: 'block', textAlign: 'center', fontSize: '28px' }}>**Dining Rules**</span>

- **Forks Requirement**: Each philosopher needs <strong>two</strong> forks to eat, one in each hand.
- **Prevention of Starvation**: Philosophers must eat regularly to avoid starvation.
- **Activity Cycle**: After eating, a philosopher will drop the forks and sleep, then start thinking when done.
- **Simulation Duration**: The simulation runs until a philosopher dies.

<span style={{ display: 'block', textAlign: 'center', fontSize: '28px' }}>**Simulation Parameters**</span>

- **Number of Philosophers**: Determines the number of forks.
- **Time to Die**: Maximum time <strong>(in ms)</strong> a philosopher can go without eating before dying.
- **Time to Eat**: Duration <strong>(in ms)</strong> a philosopher spends eating while holding both forks.
- **Time to Sleep**: Duration <strong>(in ms)</strong> a philosopher spends sleeping.
- **Optional Parameter**: Specifies how many times each philosopher <strong>must eat</strong> before the simulation stops. If not provided, the simulation stops upon a philosopher's death.

<span style={{ display: 'block', textAlign: 'center', fontSize: '28px' }}>**Behavior and Constraints**</span>

- **Philosopher Positioning**: Each philosopher is assigned a <strong>unique number</strong>, seated in a circular order.
- **Status Updates**: Actions (e.g., taking a fork, eating, sleeping) are <strong>timestamped and logged precisely</strong>, with no interleaved outputs.
- **Death Detection**: A philosopher's death must be detected and logged within <strong>10 milliseconds</strong> of the event.

---

<span style={{ display: 'block', textAlign: 'center', fontSize: '28px' }}>**Key Points**</span>

- **Isolation**: Philosophers <strong>do not communicate</strong> and remain unaware of anotherâ€™s death.
- **Thread Management**: Efficient handling of threads, using <strong>mutexes</strong> to prevent <strong>race conditions</strong> and ensure smooth simulation.

This project provides a rigorous exercise in thread management, synchronization, and adherence to coding standards, offering valuable insights into concurrent programming in C.
