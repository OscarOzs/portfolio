title: "so_long"
description: so-long is a 2D game coded in C using the MiniLibX library from 42. The player collects items and escapes via the shortest path, moving with W, A, S, and D keys. Movement through walls is restricted, and move count is shown in the shell. The game features a top-down or side view and allows creative freedom for the theme.
